# Landscape: architecture diagramming

This app is primarily for my study of the Elm language.

Someday it will be useful as a diagram-annotation program.

Right now most of its features are around observing the event model,
repeatability, and structure.

## Run the app

I'll put a version of the running app on github.io once it's OK.

Meanwhile, to run locally:

* clone this repository
* ./build
* open index.html

The image displayed describes the architecture of this app.
